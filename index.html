	<h2> Mission Statements </h2>
	<h3> The Problem </h3>
	<p> I (LordBin) and others feel the modern web is too bloated. With newer, faster and smaller technology, we expect computing to be faster and more efficient BUT, this is not true. Today, we have very fast technology compared to the technology of the early 2000, so why is the web slower. Hardware designers have been working hard to create new technologies such as: hyper threading and intergrated graphics; They have also been perfecting pre-existing technologies, We have processors that clock higher than 5Ghz, we have 4gigs of RAM on LOW END machines, and we have have internet speeds from 3Mbps to 1000Gbps. <br> As we have such amazing technology at such little prices, how come even looking up a chicken parmeson recipe takes ages to load on the modern web? Altough Hardware devs have been hard at work speeding the web up, we have a bunch of <a href="dic.html#soydev">soydevs</a> filling websites with nonsence, such as; (non-libre) javascript, backgorund scripts, advertisement, design over functionality. But how do we fix these problems

	<h3> My mission </h3>
	<p> My mission <b>lord bin</b>: is to eradicate all <b>non necassery</b> bloat & bloatware from the internet <p>
